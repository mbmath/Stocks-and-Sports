## Due to the Undesireable Output from Our Sports Analysis

We created this file using the same machine learning model to depict the output of the model when the two datasets are highly correlated

This demonstration, for the presentation, uses Visa ('V') and Mastercard ('M') as well as the Apple ('AAPL') and the NASDAQ ('GOOGL')

It uses the same Neural Network as Stonks.py, however it compares stocks to one another rather than sports data

### The same before using requirements are necessary as the Stonks.py file.
